body: "Currently the only way to control the `core` is over the agent controller.\
  \ We need a way to also be able to communicate with the core process from the local\
  \ machine itself.\r\n\r\nSome command like reboot or poweroff needs to contact the\
  \ core for it to take the proper actions. \r\nSo a simple communication channel\
  \ to core must be implemented that accepts commands directly over that channel (I\
  \ think a unix socket is sufficient)"

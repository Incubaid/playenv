  \ the results of the created vm's in the Statistics section of OVS\n\u2013> Go to\
  \ the portal\n\u2013> open the hamburger menu\n\u2013> select statistics\n\nOn the\
  \ dashboard the admin user should be able to select on of the vm's which is created\
  \ on the Gener8.\nWhen selecting the vm or physical node we should present 3 graphs.\n\
  \n1. CPU performance over time in % usage, name of graph should be \"CPU performance\"\
  \n2. Memory usage over time in % usage, name of graph should be \"Memory usage\"\
  \n3. IOPS per vm/node over time, name of the graph should be \"IOPS\"\n\u2013> When\
  \ we have this IOPS graph we need to make a distinction between type of trafic in\
  \ the same graph\n----> Initial write\n----> rewrite, read\n----> reread \n---->\

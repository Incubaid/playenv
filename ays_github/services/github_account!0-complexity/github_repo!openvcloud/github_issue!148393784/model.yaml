  When an account is made there is a default cloudspace for that account. Adding a
  user to the account and deploying a vm provides an IP address


  Every cloudspace gets an IP even when no public IP''s are assigned to that environment.


  eg. be-scale-1

  ===== 85.255.197.96/27 =====

  -----     VLAN: 111    -----


  with assigned IP for be-scale-1

  85.255.197.104 = [ scale-1  ]

  85.255.197.105 = [ scale-1  ]

  85.255.197.106 = [ scale-1  ]

  85.255.197.107 = [ scale-1  ]

  85.255.197.108 = [ scale-1  ]

  85.255.197.109 = [ scale-1  ]

  85.255.197.110 = [ scale-1  ]


  No error message is provided passing the IP limit creating the network for CS


  ## Expected behavior

  there should be a warning message deploying the cloudspace network that we do not
  have IP resources available any more.'

    We need 3 new gauges that tells the cloud broker how many

    - diskspace still available

    - cpu capacity available


    This makes this bug a FR.

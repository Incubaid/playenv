- {body: "1- make grid portal to send out telegram or mail or ... event when the status\
    \ goes to RED / ORANGE.  Provide a simple link in the telegram to the error conditions\
    \ that caused the status change\r\n\r\n2 - show traffic statistics for the networking\
    \ traffic in influx db - not only taking information from the compute nodes, but\
    \ also providing information on the switches.  Information required : bandwidth\
    \ used over last x hours / days for each NIC / each port from the switch to the\
    \ compute node / each port from the switch to the storage node / each port from\
    \ the switch to the outside world ... add these to GRAFANA graphics\r\n\r\n3 -\
    \ when networking traffic goes beyond threshold then create alarm in the portal\r\

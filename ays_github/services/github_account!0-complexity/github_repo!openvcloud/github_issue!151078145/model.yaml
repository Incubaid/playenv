body: "When create a new CS and scan its opening ports, I found that it has a 9080\
  \ HTTP port open by default.\r\n![screenshot from 2016-04-20 17-02-38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17981089/14703525/f3312a0e-07b8-11e6-823a-8fc91f901222.png)\r\
  \n\r\nDepending on this fact, Attacker can easly attack the CS using any HTTP DoS\
  \ Attack. I tested that using GoldenEye tool (Python HTTP DoS attack) and I send\
  \ a lot of packets easly to the CS_IP:Port without any banned or timeout connections.\

  \n\r\nThis is meaning that DDoS attack may be has the ability to take down the CS\
  \ easily."

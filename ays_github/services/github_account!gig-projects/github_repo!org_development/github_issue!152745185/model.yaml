    \n\r\n# A Application login flow\r\nThis is the normal oauth2 code authorization\
    \ grant type. \r\n1) User browses to the whmcs site\r\n2) User is redirected over\
    \ the Itsyou.online website and on successfull login and if the user authorizes\
    \ the whmcs site, is redirected to the whmcs site with a code. \r\n3) The whmcs\
    \ application exchanges the code for an oauth token and starts a trusted session\
    \ with the user.\r\n\r\n# B VDC access flow\r\n## B1 Minimal changes to the G8\
    \ software\r\n4) User wants access to his VDC through the VDC control panel.\r\
    \n5) Using the oauth token from step 3, the whmcs asks for a JWT token with only\
    \ the \"user:read\" scope.\r\n6) Using the JWT from step 5, login in to the G8\
    \ to get an api key\r\n7) Set the api key in the browser.\r\n8) The VDC control\

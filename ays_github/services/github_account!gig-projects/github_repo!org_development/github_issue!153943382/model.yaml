body: "## GOAL:\r\nAdd SMS for 2 factor authentication as an alternative to totp.\r\
  \n\r\n## DESCRIPTION:\r\nNot everyone knows how to use totp applications. The current\
  \ registration screen also assumes that this is available to everyone. It is better\
  \ to provide SMS as an alternative and to make the registration form more user friendly.\r\
  \n\r\nTwilio will be used as sms service.\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n- [ ] two phased login\r\
  \n    - 1: user/pass\r\n    - 2: totp/sms\r\n- [ ] prevent modification/deletion\
  \ of 2fa phonenumber\r\n\r\n"

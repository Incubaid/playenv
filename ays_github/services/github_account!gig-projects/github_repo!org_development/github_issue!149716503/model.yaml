body: '**GOAL :** Single identity managament for all gig related components


  **DESCRIPTION:**

  We need to develop an OAUTH2 based login mechanisme for WHMCS that uses itsyou.online
  as its identity provider.

  This has already been done by globalwebconcepts.net for Google & Facebook via OAuth2,
  so it should definatly be possible.

  Another useful source could be the following github repository: https://github.com/FiveGen/WHMCSGoogleOAUTH2


  **FALLBACK OPTION:**

  If this would be to much work, a hack could be to ClientLogin hook in WHMCS to make
  it use user and password combinations of itsyou.online.

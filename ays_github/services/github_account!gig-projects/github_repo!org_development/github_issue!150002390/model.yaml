  \ (VDC)\r\n DESCRIPTION:**\r\n\r\n     - Virtual datacenter (VDC) is the new name\
  \ for cloud space\r\n     - The VDC Control Panel is the equivalent of the End User\
  \ Portal, but then one Control Panel per  virtual datacenter (\"cloud space\"),\
  \ so for each VDC there is only one VDC Control Panel\r\n     - VDC Control Panel\
  \ users are authenticated by Itsyou.online\r\n     - VDC Control Panel can be stand-alone,\
  \ or embedded in Cockpit portal, or in any other web front-end such as a WHMCS end\
  \ user portal (\"WHMCS Client Area\")\r\n\r\n|status|title                     \

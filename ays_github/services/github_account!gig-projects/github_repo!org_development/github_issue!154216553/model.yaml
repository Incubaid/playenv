  \ from Stefaan (OVS) that the two chassis are now equipped with SMR disks of bad\
  \ quality. If possible replace these SMR disks with normal sata disks (140 pieces\
  \ / 4 times 35)\r\n"

    \nI assume you would like to have 35 disks per server (2 servers in one node)\
    \ so 2 quantas equipped with 70 disks... right...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", id: 218456317,

    \n\r\nabove link is what we have available,\r\n\r\nas you can see we have 69 approved\

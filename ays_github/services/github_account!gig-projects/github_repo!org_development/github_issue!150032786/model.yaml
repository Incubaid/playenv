- {body: "@despiegk \r\nMe and @zaibon where discussing the requirements and we have\
    \ few questions that need clearification. @zaibon can add more question or rephrase\
    \ mine in case they are not clear.\r\n\r\n- Can we have multiple HD attached as\
    \ backup disks? If yes, are we gonna `mirror` the files to all the backup disks,\
    \ or just span the parts across them.\r\n- Are we gonna store the plain files\
    \ on the SSD, or we gonna store them also as compressed, encrypted chunks.\r\n\
    - Why do we need the local SSD in the first place? Can't we just have the backup\
    \ disks? since the ssd can't have copy of all the backed up files due to space\
    \ imitations.\r\n- If we need the SSD disks, what would happen if the SSD got\
    \ full while the backup disks still have more space.\r\n- If we use the SSD disk\
    \ as cache so when the backup disks are shipping we still can access the backedup\
    \ files, doesn't this mean the ssd need to support storing ALL the files (again\
    \ the space limitations)\r\n\r\nI hope my questions are clean and makes, sense.\
    \ @zaibon  can elaborate more.", id: 215399933, time: '2016/04/28 11:49:32', url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/gig-projects/org_development/issues/comments/215399933',

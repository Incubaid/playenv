  \n     - -  A User sends a request to the telegram robot (G8 robot) to deploy a\
  \ cockpit for a specific organization(1)\r\n     - - The G8 robot replies with an\
  \ oauth link\r\n     - - The user authorizes the G8 robot to see it's username and\
  \ the organization(1) membership\r\n     - - The user is redirected to the G8 callback\
  \ url  At this point, the G8 robot knows the user and that he is member of the organization(1)\r\
  \n     - -  The G8 robot creates an `api secret (2)` in `G8.Cockpits`\r\n     -\
  \ -  The G8 robot deploys a cockpit and puts `G8.Cockpits` as client_id and the\
  \ api secret (2) in the settings\r\n\r\n- [x] #111 cockpit-itsyou.online: Extend\
  \ the testscript to include api secret generation\r\n- [ ] #90 cockpit-itsyou.online:\
  \ Update cockpit blueprint to configure portal login with itsyou.online oauth\r\n\

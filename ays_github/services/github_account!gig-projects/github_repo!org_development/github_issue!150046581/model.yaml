body: "**GOAL:** Allow ordering of VDC through WHMCS, triggering blueprint-based deployment\
  \ by Cockpit and management of VDC via VDC Control Panel, that can be embedded in\
  \ WHMCS\r\n\r\n**DESCRIPTION:**\r\n- Define/create order templates and product definitions\
  \ for ordering a virtual datacenter through WHMCS:\r\n  - Product/package 1: VDC\
  \ + \"a\" number of virtual cores + \"b\" amount of memory + ...\r\n  - Product/package\
  \ 2: VDC + \"x\" number of virtual cores + \"b\" amount of memory + ... \r\n- Implement\
  \ (php) hooks in WHMCS that trigger the deployment of the ordered VDC through the\
  \ Cockpit\r\n- Have one boilerplate blueprint templates available that map to a\
  \ the available WHMCS VDC products/packages (including the specification of the\
  \ cores/mem/storage/... resource limits)\r\n- Have a REST API on the Cockpit to\
  \ receive a blueprint instance, creating a new VDC based on the blueprint instance\
  \ specification\r\n- The VDC Control Panel needs to be embedded in the client area\
  \ of WHMCS ([STORY: VDC Control Panel story card](https://github.com/gig-projects/org_development/issues/38))"

  \ do autossh to cockpit\r\n    - create some info fetcher in ays8 (1 aysi) which\
  \ walks over ays7 and recreates the required ays8 instances, so we have some visibility\
  \ \r\n    - on these auto generated aysi 8 implement some methods which work on\

  \ our cockpit deployer so that we can deploy different types of cockpits e.g. this\
  \ cockpit for mgmt G8 env\r\n"

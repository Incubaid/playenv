    \n\r\nAs discussed I would like to introduce you to Willem Hendrickx (CEO), Kristof\
    \ De Spiegeleer (CTO) and Garry Veale (Adviser to the company). \r\n\r\nThe team\u2019\
    s latest company Green IT Globe (after a number of respective previous successful\
    \ ventures, exits and senior corporate roles) are in the process of fundraising.\r\
    \nPlease note I don\u2019t believe they have officially started this process of\
    \ fund raising but since we met today and it seemed to fit well with your target\
    \ investments I thought this would be an opportune introduction.\r\n\r\nI have\
    \ attached for your reference a brief introduction to the company GIG.\r\n\r\n\
    Doug, as Kristof is partly based in Dubai so when you are next over (which I understand\
    \ will be in a few weeks time) we could have a face to face meeting but in the\
    \ interim if you can please let us know a convenient time for you to have a conference\
    \ call and I will circulate a dial-in number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Willem, Kristof\
    \ and Garry,\r\n\r\nDoug Schrier is the Managing Partner of Rembrandt Venture\
    \ Partners a San Francisco based venture investing firm focusing on growth capital\
    \ for technology firms with a specific focus on investing in new software where\
    \ there is a sizeable market to be exploited backed by solid teams. \r\n\r\nDoug\
    \ both at Rembrandt and previously has had a number of successful investment and\
    \ exists (including some landmark deals).\r\n\r\nI have explained to Doug the\
    \ preference for Green IT Globe to be positioned as a European solution / alternative\
    \ to the market which he advised is ok.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\nAdrian ",

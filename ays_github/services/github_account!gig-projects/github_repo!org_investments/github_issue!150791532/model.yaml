    \ (the owner/founder of GreenITGlobe) to present to you in more detail the solution\
    \ and strategy but also the investment options.\r\nHe would be on the call with\
    \ Willem Hendrickx, the CEO and I would also like to join. I suggest having our\
    \ Russian GIG person (Andrey Yakimov) sitting with you in your office during the\
    \ call, so that he can also help explain any technicalities or questions.\r\n\
    When would you be available for such a call? Please give me a few dates and times\
    \ over the next week if possible\r\nWarm regards, Owen\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nVon:\

    \nBetreff: RE: Hello\r\n \r\nDear Owen, \r\n \r\nAs per investment decision, I\
    \ suggest to wait until Segey tests the product \u2013 it is mandatory for us.\r\
    \n \r\nMeantime, I am more than happy to conduct a conference call with CEO and\
    \ yourself to hear about the strategy and investment options.\r\n \r\nKind regards,\
    \ \r\n \r\nDenis Sitnikov\r\n \r\nFrom: OWEN KEMP [mailto:owen.kemp@newclouds.org]\

    \ Philippe\r\nSubject: Re: Hello\r\n \r\nDear Denis, Sorry for short silence\u2026\
    \r\nI will get back to you in next days with probable shipment dates for Sergey\u2019\
    s first cloud engine. Should be still in May.\r\nIf we could progress in the meantime\
    \ on the investment document, would be good: that way, assuming the delivery goes\
    \ well and Sergey is dizzy with happiness about it ;-) \r\nwe could come to a\
    \ decision about investment or not in a short period.\r\nKristof has several potential\
    \ investors and wants to agree with them soon, so it would be good to understand\
    \ if in principle (and if shipment meets all criteria) you would invest or not..\r\
    \nLet me understand please how we can come closer to such a decision\r\nThe CEO\
    \ of GreenITGlobe (i.e. Willem Hendricx, former EMEA CEO of Alcatel Lucent) is\
    \ willing to travel to Moscow any time to explain everything in more detail. Kristof\
    \ can also come \u2013 but with a bit of a lead time as he would have to get a\
    \ visa. Possibly next week or week after. And as mentioned GIG\u2019s local BDM\
    \ Andrey Yakimov can also help explain business model, financials, ROI etc any\
    \ time.\r\nThanks for your thoughts on how to progress this\r\nOwen\r\n \r\nVon:\

    \ \r\n \r\nHello. It was nice meeting you.  With respect to Clever Data, you can\
    \ write to Denis Afanasev/ CEO of Clever Data atd.afanasev@cleverdata.ru\r\n \r\
    \nI spoke with Sergey Taran regarding Green IT Globe. He is quite impressed with\
    \ potential, but yet uncertain regarding practical implications\r\n \r\nThe sooner\
    \ you can ship to him a unit for the test ( I understand that he does not need\
    \ five that the Company tries to sell to him), the sooner we can make an investment\
    \ decision\r\n \r\nAlso, look forward to receive a presentation on Vienna tax\
    \ benefits\r\n \r\nKind regards, \r\n \r\nDenis Sitnikov", id: 214213611, time: '2016/04/25
